            I like to read different types books.The books mostly I read are adventure, comics, historical, chapter, fiction and nonfiction. Books give us happiness, knowledge, information about the particular topic, introduce us with new words, fun facts etc. When I see the cover of a book, I always wonder what the book will be about and I feel to start reading that book. The place I get most of the books I read are from different Websites and online library. These are the reasons that I like to read books.</p>
